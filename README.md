# zomato-data-analysis-using-python
The "Zomato Data Analysis" project focuses on exploring and analyzing a Zomato dataset to derive valuable insights into restaurants, cuisines, locations, and user reviews. Developed using Jupyter Notebook within Anaconda Navigator, the project leverages data analysis and visualization techniques to reveal trends and patterns in the food and dining industry.
### Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Addressing missing or inconsistent data to ensure dataset quality.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into key metrics and relationships within the data.  
- **Visualizations**: Providing detailed insights through:  
  - Restaurant density across different locations.  
  - Popular cuisines and their ratings.  
  - Cost analysis across various types of restaurants.  
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Utilizing vibrant and grouped plots for enhanced data interpretation.
Libraries Used The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib: For static visualizations.
seaborn: For advanced and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations.

### File Structure  
- **ZomatoDataAnalysis.ipynb**: Main notebook with data preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations.  

### Key Visualizations  
- Count plots: Restaurant distribution by city.  
- Box plots: Cost analysis across cuisines.  
- Heatmaps: Correlations between features like ratings and cost.  

### Insights  
- Cities with the highest restaurant density identified.  
- Popular cuisines and their average ratings uncovered.  
- Cost trends analyzed by location and restaurant type.  

### Future Improvements  
- Implement machine learning for predictive analysis (e.g., rating prediction).  
- Expand the dataset with user demographics and feedback.  
- Enhance visualizations using interactive tools like Plotly or Dash.
